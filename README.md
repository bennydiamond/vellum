**vellum** is a **Minecraft: Bedrock Server** (BDS) backup and map-rendering **automation tool** primarily made to create incremental backups and render interactive maps of your world using [**PapyrusCS**](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs), all while the server is running without any server-downtime using BDS's `save hold | query | resume` commands.

## How does it work?
When this tool gets executed it creates an initial full backup of your world. Then it will launch your BDS instance as a child-process and redirects its stdout and stdin. It will then listen for certain "events" from BDS's stdout (like "Server started" messages, etc.) to determin it's current status. On an interval it will execute the `save hold | query | resume` commands and copies the required files to a temporary backup folder and compresses the world as a `.zip`-archive. It will then call PapyrusCS with user-individual arguments to render the world using the temporary world-backup directory.

## Get started
### Prerequisites
Before starting to set up this tool it is recommended to already have a [Bedrock Dedicated Server](https://www.minecraft.net/de-de/download/server/bedrock/) configured.
If you choose not to go with the self-contained release of this tool, you must have the latest [.NET Core runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-package-manager-ubuntu-1804#install-the-net-core-runtime) installed aswell.

### Installing and configuring
First of all grab the latest pre-compiled binary from the release-tab or by [**clicking here**](https://github.com/clarkx86/vellum/releases/latest). You will find two releases: A larger self-contained archive which comes bundled with the .NET Core runtime and a smaller archive which depends on you having the .NET Core runtime already installed on your system.
Download and extract the archive and `cd` into the directory with the extracted files.

You may need to give yourself execution permission with:
```
chmod +x ./vellum
```
Now run this tool for the first time by typing:
```
./vellum
```
This will generate a new `configuration.json` in the same directory. Edit this file and specify at least all required parameters ([see below for an overview](https://github.com/clarkx86/vellum#configuration)).

Now you can restart the tool one more time with the same command as above. It should now spawn the BDS instance for you and execute renders on the specified interval (do not start the server manually).
Once the server has launched through this tool you will be able to use the server console and use it's commands just like you normally would.

### Incremental backups
To create incremental world backups make sure the `CreateBackups` option is set to `true`. Backups will be stored in the directory specified by `ArchivePath`. This tool will automatically delete the oldest backups in that directory according to the threshold specified by the `BackupsToKeep` option to prevent eventually running out of disk space.

### PapyrusCS integration
This tool can automatically execute the **PapyrusCS** map-rendering tool on an interval. To do so you have to set `EnableRenders` to `true` and specify an interval in minutes with `RenderInterval`.
You can add your own arguments that will be attached when PapyrusCS is called. When configuring you will find two keys, `PapyrusGlobalArgs` and an array called `PapyrusTasks`. The value in `PapyrusGlobalArgs` specifies arguments that will be attached for each PapyrusCS task when executed, while `PapyrusTasks` represent an array of individual processes (or tasks). Adding an entry to the array represents another task that will be executed after the previous one has finished, this way it is possible to make PapyrusCS render multiple dimensions or have different configurations in general. Again, the same `PapyrusGlobalArgs` will be present for each of these tasks individually.

When specifying additional arguments for `PapyrusGlobalArgs` please make sure to **append** to the pre-generated entry (do not edit the `-w` and `-o` parameters!).
Please thoroughly verify that your paths and arguments are correct, you can find a configuration-example [here](https://github.com/clarkx86/vellum/blob/master/examples/basic_example.json).

## Configuration overview
When you run this tool for the first time, it will generate a `configuration.json` and terminate. Before restarting the tool, edit this file to your needs. Here is a quick overview:
